# ðŸš€ Kit - FastAPI Template ðŸš€

This is a pretty simplified, but complete, workflow for using Docker and Docker Compose with Django development. The included docker-compose.yml file, Dockerfiles, and config files, set up a python environment powering a Django application in the `code` directory.

## ðŸ’¥ Quick Start

1. Run `kit new django` and then answer the questions. That's it!

## ðŸ’¥ FastAPI Commands

- `build`: Runs `pip install` and `python manage.py migrate`
