# ðŸš€ Kit - Laravel Template ðŸš€

This is a pretty simplified, but complete, workflow for using Docker and Docker Compose with Laravel development. The included docker-compose.yml file, Dockerfiles, and config files, set up a LEMP stack powering a Laravel application in the `code` directory.

## ðŸ’¥ Quick Start

1. Run `kit new laravel` and then answer the questions. That's it!

## ðŸ’¥ Laravel Commands

- `build`: Runs the following:
    - `composer install`

- `composer`: Allows you to run composer commands inside the container.
